Rule for resolving include file="*.tpl" in Smarty templates:


Rule for resolving include file="*.tpl" in Smarty templates:
When an include file="*.tpl" statement is found (e.g., include file="index/custommer_em_index_product.tpl"), it means:

Start from the directory of the current template file.

Inside this index folder, look for the referenced template file (in this case, custommer_em_index_product.tpl).

In short:
include file="index/XXX.tpl" â†’ "Go to the index folder located at the same level as the current template , and load XXX.tpl from there."
